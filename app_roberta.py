## Analysis of Public Perception of Women's Participation in Football during Euro 2024
# Introduction

The importance of equal opportunities for women in sports cannot be overstated. Historically, sports have been a male-dominated arena, with women often facing significant barriers to participation, recognition, and equal treatment. However, the landscape is gradually changing, and events like the Euro 2024 are prime examples of platforms where women athletes are increasingly showcasing their talent and dedication.

# ðŸš©Analyzing public perception of women's participation in football during major events like Euro 2024 is crucial for several reasons:

âœ…Understanding Public Sentiment: Gauging how the public perceives women's participation helps stakeholders understand the level of support or opposition. This can influence policies, sponsorship, and media coverage.

âœ…Identifying Areas for Improvement: Sentiment analysis can highlight specific areas where women's participation is either praised or criticized, allowing organizations to address these issues effectively.

âœ…Promoting Equality: By continuously monitoring and analyzing public opinion, we can promote equality in sports, ensuring that women receive the recognition and opportunities they deserve.

âœ…Supporting Decision Making: Organizations, advertisers, and policy-makers can use these insights to make informed decisions that support and promote women's sports.

# ðŸš©Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand how the participation of women in football during Euro 2024 is perceived. Through sentiment analysis of posts and comments on Reddit, we aim to identify positive, negative, and neutral opinions on this topic. This information can be useful for sports organizations, journalists, and analysts who wish to understand public perception and make informed decisions.

1. APIs Used

âœ…PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper): To access posts and comments on Reddit.
âœ…Transformers by Hugging Face: To use pre-trained sentiment analysis models.
âœ…NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For sentence tokenization.
âœ…Plotly: For data visualization.

2. Model Used (Pipelines)

We used the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment sentiment analysis model provided by Hugging Face. This model is optimized for analyzing sentiments in short texts, such as social media posts and comments.
